<h2>Description</h2>
<p> This is a recipe for basic vanilla cake.</p>
<p>This is an easy recipe. Total cooking time is 1 hour(30 mins prep + 30 mins cook)</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 sticks unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus more for the pans</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for the pans</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups sugar</li>
    <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk (or 3/4 cup heavy cream mixed with 1/2 cup water)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li><p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. </p><p>Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess.</p> </li>
    <li><p>Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined.</p> <p>2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.</p> <p>Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed.</p> Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth. </li>
    <li>     Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired.    </li>
</ol>
